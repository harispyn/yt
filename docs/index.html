		<h3 id="debian">Server Configuration</h3>
		<p>When in doubt, have a pro admin or hosting provider install the required dependency packages for you. Alternatively, we can also perform the server setup for <a href="https://shop.rajwebconsulting.com/contact.php">an additional cost</a>.</p>
		<p>For the "Do-It-Yourselfers", general command-line instructions (for installing ALL required software dependencies) are available for the following, popular Linux distributions:</p>
		<p>(<b>Note:</b> <i>These instructions are provided as a convenience and courtesy to you. They are <u>not</u> a substitute for a professional server configuration. Generally, it is not our responsibility to teach you how to install and configure packages on, or administer and maintain, a Linux system.</i>)</p>	
		<p id="aaPanel-Loader" class="alert alert-danger" style="margin-top:40px"><i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Stop!!</b>&nbsp; Before continuing, we <b>strongly recommend</b> installing the free <a href="https://shop.rajwebconsulting.com/knowledgebase/1/How-To-Install-aaPanel-Free-Webpanel-incl.-LAMP.html" class="alert-link">aaPanel</a> hosting control panel <b>instead of using the command line</b> to achieve a comparable server configuration. aaPanel will also facilitate the installation of the <a href="https://shop.rajwebconsulting.com/knowledgebase/5/HowTo-install-ionCube-Loader-in-aaPanel.html" class="alert-link">ionCube Loader</a>, another software requirement that <b>must</b> be installed <b>after</b> all other requirements have been met/installed.</p><br />

E.g., a value of 5 saves an MP3 in the cache after 5 downloads of the same video.

I.e., YouTube's reported video duration is compared to the duration of the cached file on your server.

So, it is IMPORTANT that this value is set to significantly lower than the actual space available for the cache folder on the hard drive! You can further mitigate this issue by increasing the _CACHE_SIZE_BUFFER constant value, running the scheduled task more often, and/or ensuring that you always have plenty of unused, available hard disk space.

// (IMPORTANT: The _ENABLE_IP_ROTATION_FOR_SEARCH and _ENABLE_IP_ROTATION_FOR_VIDEOS settings (see below) operate independently, so _ENABLE_IP_ROTATION_FOR_VIDEOS does NOT need to be "true" for _ENABLE_IP_ROTATION_FOR_SEARCH to work, and vice versa. Furthermore, with exception to _DISABLE_IP_FOR_DOWNLOAD, _ENABLE_IP_ROTATION_FOR_SEARCH uses the exact SAME "Rotating IPs Constants" section values that _ENABLE_IP_ROTATION_FOR_VIDEOS does or would.

This value only applies to the DATABASE METHOD (and not the TOR METHOD, which always behaves "sequentially").
const _MAX_CURL_TRIES = 10;  // Maximum number of times code tries a HTTP request, regardless of IP rotation method used, before giving up. (When using the DATABASE METHOD, this value will vary depending on the number of IPs in the rotation.

const _DISABLE_IP_FOR_DOWNLOAD = true;  // When true, the code will first try to use the primary server IP for video/audio file downloads. In this case, the current IP in rotation is only used if the initial download request fails. (Related HTTP requests will still only use the current IP in rotation.)

				<li>Now repeat the process, substituting "http://www.your-domain-here.com" with "http://www.google.com" (or any other domain name other than your site's domain name!) this time.</li>
				<li>If the above code consistently <i>fails</i> for any reason, in any way, when CURLOPT_URL is set to "http://www.your-domain-here.com", but consistently <i>works</i> when CURLOPT_URL is set to "http://www.google.com" (or any other domain name other than your site's domain name!), then you likely have an issue with your DNS. Evidently, HTTP requests made from your server are able to correctly resolve the DNS of all sites except your own -- indicating an issue with your own DNS configuration. Possible fixes include using another DNS provider, changing nameservers, and/or having a professional configure your DNS for you.</li>

			<b id="download_error">When I click the MP3 and/or MP4 buttons for a given video, I get an error message and the download links don't appear. Why is this?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Verify that software.xml exists in the "store" directory, and that the file is chmod to 0777 permissions. Also, ensure that "store" directory permissions allow programmatic modification of software.xml. If software.xml exists, try deleting the file and allowing it to automatically regenerate.</li>
				<li>Try executing a simple PHP cURL request to the corresponding video page URL, and return the contents of the page to the screen. For example, place the following code in a new file, replacing the "vidID" URL query string parameter value with a valid YouTube video ID:</li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
&lt;?php

// create a new cURL resource
$ch = curl_init();

// set URL and other appropriate options
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vidID");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1);

// grab URL and pass it to the browser
curl_exec($ch);

// print out any cURL errors as well as HTTP response information
echo 'Curl error: (' . curl_errno($ch) . ') ' . curl_error($ch) . '&lt;br&gt;';

				<li>(<b>Note:</b> You can retrieve the video page URL and corresponding ID for any given video by clicking the "Preview Video" button underneath the video thumbnail image!)</li>
				<li>Save the file, upload it to your server, and open it in a browser. Do you see the HTML page located at that URL? If the video is blocked in your server's country, then this will be indicated in the screen's output. A blank page or CAPTCHA screen could indicate that your IP has either been temporarily banned or flagged (via the CAPTCHA) for exceeding video pull quota limits. It could also mean that your server is having networking issues.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>First, check that the _FFMPEG_PATH and _CURL_PATH constant values in "lib/Config.php" point to the correct locations of the corresponding binary files on your server. On Linux, you can locate FFmpeg and cURL via the command line interface as follows, e.g.:</li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">root@server:~# type ffmpeg<br />ffmpeg is /usr/bin/ffmpeg</pre></li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">root@server:~# which ffmpeg<br />/usr/bin/ffmpeg</pre></li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">root@server:~# type curl<br />curl is /usr/bin/curl</pre></li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">root@server:~# which curl<br />/usr/bin/curl</pre></li>
				<li>Does FFmpeg work from the command console? Try running a FFmpeg command directly in the command line interface. Preferably, run a command that is executed by our software during conversions.</li>
				<li>Are you running the most recent version of FFmpeg? (Check your FFmpeg version by typing "ffmpeg" in the command console. If the dates shown in the resulting output are more than 1-2 years old, <i>or</i> the version number is less than 3.3.4, then you may have an outdated version of FFmpeg.) Also, the software may not work as expected with FFmpeg builds downloaded from the "apt-get" repository on Debian/Ubuntu (or the "yum" repository on CentOS). Instead, for these Linux distributions, try <a href="http://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/">downloading a recent, static build of FFmpeg</a>. To install the static build, simply upload the downloaded FFmpeg binary file to your "/usr/bin" (or similar) directory.</li>
				<li>You may need to set permissions of the FFmpeg binary to chmod 0777, or lower -- if possible, so that our software has permission to access FFmpeg. This especially holds true for people using a static build of FFmpeg.</li>
				<li>Try "temporarily" enabling Debug Mode in "lib/Config.php":</li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">// When enabled, Debug Mode inserts FFmpeg/cURL command-line output/errors directly into downloaded MP3 and Video/Merged Stream files.<br />// Downloaded files can subsequently be opened in a text editor to troubleshoot commands' standard output and errors.<br />const _DEBUG_MODE = true;</pre></li>
				<li>With Debug Mode enabled, download an MP3 (or Video/Merged Stream) and then open the resulting file in a script editor to determine if any FFmpeg/cURL errors were generated during cURL download and/or FFmpeg conversion. I.e., if the file (open in your editor) contains error messages, then there is likely an issue with FFmpeg/cURL. Otherwise, there is no issue with FFmpeg/cURL.</li>
				<li>Alternatively, if Debug Mode is already enabled in the software, then try disabling it in "lib/Config.php":</li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">// When enabled, Debug Mode inserts FFmpeg/cURL command-line output/errors directly into downloaded MP3 and Video/Merged Stream files.<br />// Downloaded files can subsequently be opened in a text editor to troubleshoot commands' standard output and errors.<br />const _DEBUG_MODE = false;</pre></li>
				<li>Because Debug Mode prints FFmpeg/cURL standard output and error messages to downloaded files, this could potentially result in corrupt or non-playable media files.
    			<li>Also ensure that:
    				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    					<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/outcontrol.configuration.php#ini.output-buffering">The PHP "output_buffering" directive</a> is set to "On" or, e.g., "4096".</li>
    					<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit">The PHP "memory_limit" directive</a> is set to at least the PHP default value, "128M".</li>
    				</ul>
    			</li>
    			<li>On cPanel servers (or servers that support a custom php.ini file), you can create a new file and add the following content:</li>
    			<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">output_buffering = On<br />memory_limit = 128M</pre></li>
    			<li>...then save this file as "php.ini" and upload it to your web root directory.</li>
			</ul>

			<b id="template">How and where do I edit the default template and design?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>This software employs many principles of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC paradigm</a>, so all "presentation logic" is located in the <b>"/app/Templates/default"</b> and <b>"/app/Views"</b> directories.</li>
				<li>In terms of customization, most of your efforts should focus on editing the "default" template in the "/app/Templates/default" directory. Here you will find common header and footer files as well as all CSS, JavaScript, images, and other related dependencies. <u>You can create an entirely different look for the software by editing only the files in this directory and its subdirectories</u>.</li>
				<li>If you want to create your own, brand-new template, then you can copy the "/app/Templates/default" folder to a new folder named, e.g., "/app/Templates/mytemplate". Then you must change the following constant value in "/lib/Config.php" to (per the example):</li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">// Template Folder Name<br />const _TEMPLATE_NAME = "mytemplate";</pre></li>
				<li>Additional presentation-related code is located in the "/app/Views" directory and its subdirectories. But <u>take care when editing code here because some of this code is vital for the display of crucial software functionality</u>.</li>
				</li>Subdirectories of "/app/Views" that are worth noting:
					<ol>
						<li><b>"/app/Views/pages"</b>:
							<ul>
								<li>Files in this folder effectively embody new "pages" in the software. Pages can either be served synchronously or asynchronously (via AJAX), but they are all pages nonetheless. Each page file corresponds to a function (of the same name) in the "/app/Controllers/PagesController.php" file, and these functions perform "pre-presentation" logic before passing resulting PHP variable values to the pages.</li>
								<li>For example, the faq() function in "/app/Controllers/PagesController.php":</li>
								<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">function faq()
{
	$this->SetVars(array('uppercase' => true));
	return $this->render(dirname(__DIR__) . "/" . self::_VIEWS_PATH . "/" . self::_PAGES_DIR, __FUNCTION__, TEMPLATE_NAME);
}						</pre></li>
								<li>...creates an $uppercase PHP variable (with boolean value 'true') that can be used anywhere in "/app/Views/pages/faq.php". And "return $this->render()" is what <i>renders</i> and ultimately displays the "faq.php" page.</li>
								<li><u>To add a new page to the software</u>, you can add a similar, new function to "/app/Controllers/PagesController.php" and then create a corresponding page file (with the same name!) in "/app/Views/pages".</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>"/app/Views/elements"</b>:
							<ul>
								<li>"Elements" are small chunks of (often reusable) markup (or presentation code) that can be inserted inside page files in "/app/Views/pages" <i>and</i> inside template header/footer files (e.g., in "/app/Templates/default/layouts").</li>
								<li>For example, the default template consumes a "navbar_links" element in "/app/Templates/default/layouts/default/header.php" like so:</li>
								<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">&lt;?php echo $this->element('navbar_links'); ?&gt;</pre></li>
								<li>This code automatically includes and <i>renders</i> the file "/app/Views/elements/navbar_links.php" inside "header.php".</li>
								<li><u>To add a new element to the software</u>, create a new file in "/app/Views/elements", insert your custom markup/code, and then render it inside a page or header/footer file via "echo $this->element('element_name')". (Ensure that 'element_name', per the preceding example, is <u>the same name</u> as the new, corresponding file in "/app/Views/elements"!)
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<b id="files_saved">Are downloaded/converted files saved on the server?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>No! You need very little hard disk space because nothing is stored on the server. A mere 50 MB (minimum) of disk space is required.</li>
			</ul>

			<b id="yt-api-quota">My YouTube API key (or keys) is frequently over the API's daily limit/quota. Aside from using multiple keys, what can I do?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>If you find that <a href="#youtubeAPIMultiple">using multiple YouTube API keys</a> is not enough to service your site's daily traffic, then you can eliminate <i>all</i> requests to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list">YouTube Data API's "search" endpoint</a> (and <i>the majority</i> of requests to its <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list">"videos" endpoint</a>) by leveraging the software's built-in "YouTube.com search scraping" feature.</li>
				<li>First, let's higlight this functionality in the proper context. By default, the software consumes the "videos", "playlistItems", and "search" YouTube API endpoints. Each request sent to one of these endpoints incurs a "cost" of X number of "units", and each API key is allocated a finite number of total units per day. By far, "search" API requests cost the most, at 100 units per request. Other API requests (used in this software) pale in comparison, costing a mere 1 unit per request!</li>
				<li>That said, <u>there is nearly an infinite number of possible YouTube keyword searches</u>. And, by default, for every keyword search, a single "videos" API request generates data for all corresponding video search results. So, even though "search" requests consume the most API units, the number of "videos" requests grows at a directly proportional rate. I.e., despite the relatively low cost of "videos" requests, they become increasingly costly over time with more and more unique keyword searches!</li>
				<li>So, ultimately, this demonstrates how the provision of a "YouTube.com search scraping" feature further mitigates increased API consumption (that naturally comes with more website traffic). <u>By replacing the most costly API requests with a viable alternative, YouTube API consumption is dramatically reduced, which effectively increases each API key's daily quota and significantly reduces the total number of keys required to sustain higher levels of traffic</u>.</li>
				<li>But <u>how does it work</u>? Search scraping is regulated by the _ENABLE_SEARCH_SCRAPING and _SEARCH_SCRAPING_POPULATES_VID_INFO constant values:
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li><a href="#config-search">The _ENABLE_SEARCH_SCRAPING constant value in "lib/Config.php"</a> <u>must</u> be set to true (and it is true, by default). This setting eliminates <i>all</i> requests to the YouTube API's "search" endpoint, and scraped search results are automatically cached (leveraging the same mechanism used for YouTube API response caching).</li>
						<li><a href="#config-search">The _SEARCH_SCRAPING_POPULATES_VID_INFO constant value in "lib/Config.php"</a> determines whether or not additional requests to the YouTube API's "videos" endpoint are also eliminated. I.e., a true value will eliminate the vast majority of "videos" requests that are otherwise issued for keyword searches. (<b>Note:</b> Because "YouTube.com search scraping" is incapable of yielding the <i>exact same</i> output as "videos" API requests, this setting will remove video likes, dislikes, and rating from each search result.)</li>
						<li id="api-exceptions">In general, <u>most YouTube API requests are eliminated when "both" _ENABLE_SEARCH_SCRAPING "and" _SEARCH_SCRAPING_POPULATES_VID_INFO are set to true</u>.
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
								<li>Minor and/or infrequent exceptions include "Top Videos" charts, playlist searches, and scraped video page URL searches that return no results (which still rely on requests to the YouTube API's "videos", "playlistItems", and "videos" endpoints, respectively).</li>
								<li>To put this into perspective: By default, there are 95 "Top Videos" (country) charts that each require a single "videos" API request. So, if all charts are visited in the same 24-hour period, then 95 total API units are consumed (i.e., 95 x 1 units each). Playlist searches are relatively rare and cost 1 API unit apiece. Finally, and even more rare, scraped searches for video URLs that return no results consume 1 API unit each (because, in that case, the YouTube API is used as a backup). So, <u>considering that YouTube API responses are automatically cached for at least 24 hours</u> (by default), then <u>it's distinctly possible that no YouTube API key's quota is ever exceeded in a given 24-hour period</u>!</li>

			<b id="yt-captcha">I think YouTube is blocking or banning my IP address, and/or I am experiencing a CAPTCHA page when trying to connect to YouTube. What can I do?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>First of all, bans are usually temporary. In our experience, YouTube only blocks/bans your IP for a finite period of time. The amount of time will vary -- generally, anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.</li>
				<li>If you are frequently getting blocked by YouTube, OR you are experiencing a CAPTCHA page, then <u>you can rotate between multiple IPs for ALL outgoing video-, search-, and download-related requests</u>.
				<li>There are currently multiple variations of "IP Rotation" available:
					<ol>
						<li id="yt-captcha-db-method"><b>The "Database" Method</b>:
							<ul>
								<li>In this case, you will need to purchase/acquire additional IPs. It's reasonable to "start" with 8-10 IPs for the purpose of IP rotation. These extra IPs generally only cost a couple of dollars apiece, and you can always buy more later (and add them to the rotation) as needed.</li>
								<li>That said, the more IPs you have, the better off you will be. In general, the number of additional IPs required for your site is directly proportional to the amount of traffic to your site.</li>
								<li>The "Database" Method supports the following kinds of IPs:
									<ol>
										<li id="yt-captcha-proxy"><b>IPs configured as "proxies"</b> <i>(recommended)</i>:
											<ul>
												<li>In the recent past, <u>proxy IPs are generally more robust and last longer than IPs configured as "outgoing network interfaces"</u> (see below).</li>
												<li>There are many ways to implement and consume proxies. Here are 4 common scenarios, starting with the easiest:
													<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
														<li>Purchase private proxy IPs from a dedicated, 3rd-party proxy provider like <a href="http://instantproxies.com/billing/aff.php?aff=061">InstantProxies</a>. (In our experience, InstantProxies provides robust proxies at a competitive price.) This is also a quick and effective way to gauge approximately <i>how many</i> proxies you need for your current traffic volume.</li>
														<li>Purchase one or more "reverse backconnect rotating proxy" IPs from a dedicated, 3rd-party proxy provider like <a href="https://stormproxies.com/rotating_reverse_proxies.html">Storm Proxies</a>. This solution is better and more cost-effective than, e.g., InstantProxies, IF (and only if) you need a high volume of IPs.</li>
														<li>Purchase an inexpensive VPS, configure it as a proxy using something like <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Intro/">Squid</a>, and then use the VPS IP as a proxy IP.</li>
														<li>Purchase an inexpensive VPS, purchase additional failover IPs from your hosting provider, configure the additional IPs as proxies using something like <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Intro/">Squid</a>, install <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> on the VPS, and use HAProxy to rotate between these proxies. In this case, only the primary VPS IP is inserted into our software's "IP rotation" feature, and HAProxy automatically selects a proxy when a request is sent to the VPS IP.</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>In general, you should follow these guidelines:
													<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
														<li>Choose proxies that are geographically very near to your web server. (In a perfect world, the proxy server would be sitting right next to the web server in the same data center.)</li>
														<li>Choose "private" instead of "shared" proxies. Ideally, you should be the only person using the proxy, and you should not use it for anything more than proxy requests.</li>
														<li>Your proxies should have network bandwidth and connection speeds comparable to your web server.</li>
														<li>Avoid free proxy IPs. These proxies are shared with the rest of the world, and they get banned quickly by popular sites (like YouTube).</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li id="yt-captcha-interface"><b>IPs configured as "outgoing network interfaces"</b>:
											<ul>
												<li>Start by purchasing some additional, "failover" IP (IPv4) addresses from your hosting provider. (Often your hosting plan will include additional IPs for free!)</li>
												<li>Next, configure these additional IP addresses so that they can be used as "outgoing network interfaces". Simply put, your server needs to be configured so that it can "bind" to these extra IPs for HTTP requests. The easiest way to accomplish this is to have your hosting provider do this for you. If you must do this yourself, then you can refer to <a href="https://docs.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated/network-ipaliasing/">OVH's guide for setting up "Network IP Aliasing"</a> for a number of different Linux distributions (and Windows).</li>
												<li><b>Note:</b> Don't use IPv6 IPs because the entire IPv6 IP "block" (or range) is banned when a single IP within that block is banned!</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li id="yt-captcha-variations">There are 2 variations of the "Database" Method (set via <a href="#config-iprot">the _IP_ROTATION_METHOD constant value in "lib/Config.php"</a>):
									<ol>
										<li><b>"sequential"</b> <i>(recommended)</i>:
											<ul>
												<li>In the recent past, <u>the "sequential" method is generally more robust and lasts longer than the "round-robin" method</u> (see below).</li>
												<li>This method uses the same IP for all YouTube requests until that IP is banned, and then (and only then) advances to the next IP in rotation.</li>
												<li>This method operates on the principle that the first IP in rotation will no longer be banned after the last IP is banned. (I.e., given enough IPs in rotation, enough time will have elapsed since the first IP ban that this ban will be lifted once the final IP is banned.)</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li><b>"round-robin"</b>:
											<ul>
												<li>The "round-robin" method distributes YouTube requests equally to each IP in rotation.</li>
												<li>Banned IPs are temporarily removed from rotation as per <a href="#config-iprot">the _IP_BAN_PAUSE constant value in "lib/Config.php"</a>.
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li id="yt-captcha-buildSQL">There are 2 ways to generate the SQL required to build the corresponding "ips" and/or "ips_search" database table(s) (used for obtaining video info/files and scraping search results, respectively):
									<ol>
										<li><b>Use our <a href="https://rajwebconsulting.com/build-sql/">online tool</a></b> <i>(recommended)</i>:
											<ul>
												<li>Use our online tool to <a href="https://rajwebconsulting.com/build-sql/">easily generate all of the SQL required</a> to build your own "ips"/"ips_search" database table!</li>
												<li>Simply paste your IPs into the form, set the "Table Name" dropdown menu value to "ips" or "ips_search", submit the form, and then execute the resulting SQL code in a MySQL database on your server.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li><b>Use the SQL provided in "docs/ips.sql" and/or "docs/ips_search.sql"</b>:
											<ul>
												<li>Use the SQL provided in "docs/ips.sql" and/or "docs/ips_search.sql" to create the required database table(s) that will hold your IPs.</li>
												<li><u>Ensure that you replace the IPs in the SQL INSERT query with your own IP addresses "before" executing the SQL!</u></li>
												<li>Additional IP addresses can be added to the INSERT query by copying the format and adding lines to the query.</li>
												<li>For example, let's say you have the following 4 IPs configured as "outgoing network interfaces": 154.182.169.235, 136.182.135.157, 37.123.36.58, and 170.48.117.222. And you have another 4 IPs configured as "proxies": 83.220.171.161:3128, 234.17.39.229:3128, 48.143.35.132:3128, and 187.237.71.67:3128. (<b>Note:</b> The number after the ":" in these proxy IPs is referred to as the server "port". Generally, only proxy IPs will have this.) In this case, you would modify the SQL INSERT query in "docs/ips.sql" (or "docs/ips_search.sql") as follows:</li>
												<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">INSERT INTO `ips` (`ip`, `port`, `proxy_user`, `proxy_pass`, `usage_count`, `banned`) VALUES

('187.237.71.67', '3128', '', '', 0, 0);
												</pre></li>
												<li>Sometimes, you will also have proxies that require authentication. For example, let's say you have an additional proxy, 161.81.186.211:8080, with username "randallj" and password "getlucky123". You would then update the previous INSERT query like so:</li>
												<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">INSERT INTO `ips` (`ip`, `port`, `proxy_user`, `proxy_pass`, `usage_count`, `banned`) VALUES
('154.182.169.235', '', '', '', 0, 0),

									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>In the future, whenever you want to add another IP address to the rotation, then you simply add the new IP or IPs to the corresponding database table.</li>
								<li>(<b>Note:</b> BOTH the "ips" AND "ips_search" tables MUST be in the SAME database as the <a href="#config-dbase">software license's "local key" table</a>!)</li>

														<li>Since IPs used for video info/files "download" requests are generally blocked faster than those used for search scraping (as noted, below), you can replace blocked IPs as needed without the concern that these IPs could still be used for video info/files "download" requests.

												</li>
												<li><b>Note:</b> At this time, using 2 different sets of IPs is intended as a "failsafe" measure. I.e., while its implementation is absolutely effective, it should generally only be considered if/when YouTube makes changes that require 2 sets of IPs.</li>

								<li>Moreover, when using the "Database" Method for BOTH search scraping AND video info/files "download" requests, <u>the same "variation"</u> (either <a href="#yt-captcha-variations">"sequential" or "round-robin"</a>) <u>is used for <i>all</i> requests</u>.</li>
								<li>If you find that, with IP rotation enabled, you are still experiencing IP bans and/or CAPTCHAs, then that is generally a sign that you need to add more IP addresses to the rotation (to the corresponding database table). You must keep adding IPs until YouTube downloads/conversions/search start working normally.</li>
								<li>If you suspect that there is a problem with the IPs themselves, or the IP configuration on your server, then you should first test each additional IP using the following, simple PHP cURL code:

								<li>Ensure that you change the CURLOPT_INTERFACE or CURLOPT_PROXY value to your IP address (and port number, for proxies). Then save the code to a .php file and run it on your server. If you see a video but it won't play, you don't see a video, or you get a cURL error and/or curious HTTP response, then there is something wrong with the IP or its configuration.</li>
								<li>To address issues with IPs configured as "outgoing network interfaces", on some servers, you can try commenting out this line of code, like so:</li>
								<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">//curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE, CURL_IPRESOLVE_V4);  </pre></li>

							</ul>
						</li>
						<li id="yt-captcha-tor-method"><b>The "Tor" Method</b>:
							<ul>
								<li>In this case, you do <u>not</u> need to purchase/acquire additional IP addresses. Instead, you leverage <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en">Tor</a>, a free global proxy network.</li>
								<li>The simplest way to enable Tor on your server is to install our custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker</a> image and follow the corresponding, detailed instructions provided via <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rajwebconsulting/tor-proxy">our Docker Hub repository</a>. Our Docker image is configured to optimize your anonymity and security while connected to the Tor network by (among other things):
									<ol>
										<li>Limiting Tor connectivity to outbound requests only. In short: You can use other "nodes" on the Tor network for proxy connections, but other nodes cannot use your server for similar connections. I.e., you are completely insulated from the rest of the Tor network.</li>
										<li>Using non-standard server ports for Tor connections.</li>
										<li>Password-protecting all requests to the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/control-spec.txt">Tor control protocol</a>, which is the specification and service that enables the software to dynamically set and change the current Tor proxy IP.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>The "Tor" Method functions in a way that is similar to the "Database" Method's "sequential" variation. I.e., when a proxy IP is fetched from the Tor network, that same IP is used for all subsequent YouTube requests until it is banned, and then (and only then) a new Tor proxy IP is generated and used. (And this process is repeated indefinitely.)</li>
								<li>The same Tor proxy IP is used for BOTH search scraping AND video info/files "download" requests. Thus, if a Tor IP becomes blocked for <i>either</i> kind of request, then a new proxy IP is generated and used for <i>all</i> requests.</li>
								<li>The primary attraction of the "Tor" Method is that it's free, and it unburdens you of the prospect of buying/acquiring more and more proxies as your traffic volume increases (i.e., when using the "Database" Method). But Tor is far from perfect. Because Tor nodes are shared by the rest of the world, network speeds are sometimes slow.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>In all cases, you should <a href="#config-iprot">configure the corresponding constant values in "lib/Config.php"</a> in preparation for IP Rotation. This file is well-documented, and all constants related to IP Rotation and the database are throroughly explained in the associated comment sections.</li>
				<li>Finally, please also consider the following:
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li><a href="#config-iprot">The _ENABLE_IP_ROTATION_FOR_VIDEOS constant value in "lib/Config.php"</a> does NOT need to be true if you are ONLY rotating IPs for the purpose of search scraping! Conversely, <a href="#config-iprot">the _ENABLE_IP_ROTATION_FOR_SEARCH constant value in "lib/Config.php"</a> does NOT need to be true if you are ONLY rotating IPs for the purpose of video info/files "download" requests!</li>
						<li>Evidence suggests that <u>IPs used for search scraping are blocked much less often than IPs used for video info/files "download" requests</u>. Thus, the net result is that <u>less overall IPs are required for search scraping requests vs. video info/files "download" requests</u>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<b id="yt-blocked">I think a video or group of videos is blocked in my server's country. What can I do?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>All countries have some blocked videos. All of them. The only way that you could "unblock" all of these videos is to leverage a global proxy network like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en">Tor</a>. In fact, Tor is the only global proxy network that we are aware of at this time, and it is notoriously known for its slow connection speeds.</li>
				<li>A more practical approach is to unblock as many videos as you can without spending a lot of extra money, making a lot of extra work for youself, and generally inducing massive, debilitating headaches.</li>
				<li>The easiest way to avoid blocked videos is to choose a web server in a country that, generally, has few blocked videos. In our experience, the USA, United Kingdom, France, and Germany have the least number of blocked videos. You would do yourself a favor to choose a datacenter located in one of these countries.</li>
				<li>Another way to thwart blocked videos is to use dedicated proxy IPs in your HTTP and download requests to YouTube. Perferably, these proxies should also be located in the USA, United Kingdom, France, or Germany. In fact, you should ideally use proxies from multiple different countries to unblock as many videos as possible. This software supports proxy integration via the "<a href="#yt-captcha">IP rotation</a>" feature.</li>

			<b id="language">How do I add/edit language translations?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>There are 2 primary components of the software's language translation engine:
					<ol>
						<li><b>"app/Languages/index.php"</b>:
							<ul>
								<li>This file lists all available languages in a PHP array. Each array key is the corresponding <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">ISO 639-1 language code</a>, and each array value is another array containing additional information about the language.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>"app/Languages/{language code}.php"</b>:
							<ul>
								<li>These files are named using the corresponding <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">ISO 639-1 language code</a> (e.g., "en.php" or "de.php"). Each file contains a PHP array of translations for a given language. Array keys are used to display translations in other parts of the software (e.g., $translations['website_title'] will return the 'website_title' translation).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><b><u>To add a new language</u></b>: Add the language to "app/Languages/index.php" (via a new array element), open "app/Languages/en.php" and replace all translations with the new language's translations, and then save the file as {language code}.php. <i>For example, to add the French language:</i>
					<ul>
						<li><b>"app/Languages/index.php"</b></li>
						<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">return array(
    'en' => array(

			<b id="api">How do I enable the JSON REST APIs and/or the Button/Iframe API?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>The software comes with 3 ready-to-consume APIs: A JSON and Button/Iframe API for easy consumption of video download data/links, and a JSON "Search" API for manipulating YouTube search results (generated via the <a href="#yt-api-quota">"YouTube.com search scraping" feature</a>).</li>
				<li>(<b>Note:</b> All three APIs can technically function <i>without</i> consuming the YouTube Data API. Nevertheless, when using the JSON "Search" API, it is recommended to have at least one working YouTube API key -- <a href="#api-exceptions">in the unlikely event that a valid video URL search does not return any results</a>. Moreover, the JSON "Search" API also requires setting "true" values for "both" the <a href="#config-search">_ENABLE_SEARCH_SCRAPING "and" _SEARCH_SCRAPING_POPULATES_VID_INFO constants</a>!)</li>
				<li>The APIs are disabled by default. To enable one or more APIs, you must <a href="#config-apis">edit the $_apiAllowedDomains array in 'lib/Config.php'</a> per the instructions provided in the corresponding code comments.</li>
				<li>You can whitelist (restrict) access to any API by adding specific domains and/or IPs to the corresponding $_apiAllowedDomains 'json', 'button', and/or 'search' subarrays. If any subarray is left empty, then this enables unrestricted, public access to the corresponding API. When at least one API is made public in this way, an 'API' menu link and page is automatically added to your site. This page provides your website users with detailed instructions for consuming all available public APIs.</li>
				<li>For further information related to the consumption of each API, please <a href="../@developers/preview">review a preview of the 'API' page here</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<b id="mp3_cache">How do I enable MP3 file caching, and how does the cache work?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>By default, the software is configured with MP3 caching disabled. To enable it, you must <a href="#config-cache">edit the _CACHE_FILES constant value in 'lib/Config.php'</a>.</li>
				<li>In a nutshell, this feature stores and reuses previously converted MP3 files, so that the same files aren't downloaded and converted over and over again. This ultimately results in <u>a significant savings of resources (foremost, CPU and bandwidth) on your server!</u></li>
				<li><b><u>To increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of your cache</u></b>, MP3 files are only cached after the "nth" conversion of a given video, per the <a href="#config-cache">_CACHE_AFTER_X constant value</a>. (E.g., a value of 2 only saves an MP3 in the cache after 2 prior conversions of the same video.) This setting ultimately ensures that only "more popular" files are cached, thereby making more efficient use of available cache space and saving CPU (required to run FFmpeg) only where you most need it -- for popular videos!</li>
				<li><b><u>To maintain and control cache size</u></b>, the <a href="#config-cache">_MAX_CACHE_SIZE and _CACHE_SIZE_BUFFER constant values</a> are leveraged. In addition, you'll need to set up "inc/schedule.php" to run as a regular cron job on your server (ideally, every 15-60 minutes). Some cron command examples include:</li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-html"># Once every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php -q /absolute/path/to/schedule.php

# Once every 30 minutes
0,30 * * * * /usr/bin/php -q /absolute/path/to/schedule.php

# Once every hour
0 * * * * /usr/bin/php -q /absolute/path/to/schedule.php
				</pre></li>
				<li>(Prior to scheduling the cron job, <u>you must set file permissions of "inc/schedule.php" to chmod 0755 and uncomment all unlink() and rmdir() commands in "inc/schedule.php" to ensure that cached files are actually deleted</u>!)</li>
				<li>Essentially, _MAX_CACHE_SIZE is the maximum size that the cache can grow on your server, measured in kilobytes, before the oldest cached files are deleted by the cron job. <b>Note:</b> Because file deletions are only performed when the cron job is run, <i>the actual size of the cache may exceed this value between cron jobs</i>. So, it is IMPORTANT that this value is set to significantly lower than the actual space available on the hard drive! You can further mitigate this issue by increasing the _CACHE_SIZE_BUFFER constant value (see below), running the scheduled task more often, and/or ensuring that you always have plenty of unused, available hard disk space.</li>
				<li>_CACHE_SIZE_BUFFER (also measured in kilobytes) is in fact a buffer of sorts, and it is used to help keep the actual size of the cache as close to _MAX_CACHE_SIZE as possible (in between regular executions of the cron job). So, if caching is enabled and the cache size is greater than _MAX_CACHE_SIZE (when the cron job is run), then the oldest files in the cache are deleted one at a time until the cache size is less than _MAX_CACHE_SIZE minus the _CACHE_SIZE_BUFFER value.</li>
				<li>Ultimately, the goal is to make the cache size a little less than _MAX_CACHE_SIZE after each execution of the cron job, so that the cache size consistently stays under or as close as possible to the _MAX_CACHE_SIZE value. That said, <u>it's not a perfect science</u>, so you'll have to experiment with different values for _MAX_CACHE_SIZE, _CACHE_SIZE_BUFFER, and the frequency with which the cron job runs, to maintain optimal cache size on your server.</li>
				<li><i><b>Note:</b> Only MP3 files are cached at this time because only MP3 downloads require FFmpeg.</i><li>
			</ul>

			<b id="copyright">How can I block certain videos at the behest of copyright holders?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>The software is equipped with a mechansim to easily disable the download/conversion of any given video or videos. To "block" a video in this way, simply edit the corresponding section of "lib/Config.php":</li>
				<li><pre class="prettyprint lang-php">// List of YouTube video IDs that are intentionally "blocked" and thus cannot be downloaded/converted
// E.g., this can be used to disable video download/conversion at the copyright holder's request
// Each video ID added to the array must be in the format, e.g.: 'J_ub7Etch2U' => 'block'
public static $_blockedVideos = array(
	'J_ub7Etch2U' => 'block',
	'YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE' => 'block'
);
				</pre></li>
				</li>Each video ID "element" added to the array must be separated by commas and appear in the following format, e.g.: <i>'J_ub7Etch2U' => 'block'</i></li>
				<li><i><b>Note:</b> Even cached videos can be blocked in this way!</i></li>
